# PYGGUI
A pygame GUI utility tool that anything from texts to advanced forms and popup's

This script deals with the pygame event loop and allows you to create advanced buttons, forms and pop-up menu's easily. 

This is more to be used as part of a game launcher or very menu heavy pygames. But can be used anywhere that uses a pygame surface.
